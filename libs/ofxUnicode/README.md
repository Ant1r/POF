ofxUnicode
==========

An openFrameworks addon that wraps the UTF8-CPP and POCO libraries for UTF8 and Unicode support.

There is also a banch that is implemented with [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/).  This will likely become the main branch in the future.


---------

This addon has been added to ofxPof for compilation ease, 
as well as ofxFontStash which depends on it.
